The Spark Foundation Tasks

### Task 1: Prediction using supervised ML
[As we know, Machine learning is a method of data analysis that helps in building models. It is a branch of artificial intelligence(AI) based on the idea that systems 
can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It has various types one being supervised learning in which the algorithm 
learns on a labeled dataset, which acts as an answer key that the algorithm can use to evaluate its accuracy on training data.]

### Task 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
[As we know, Machine learning is a method of data analysis that helps in building models. It is a branch of artificial intelligence(AI) based on the idea that systems 
can learn from data, identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention. It has various types, one being unsupervised learning in which the users do 
not need to supervise the model. Instead, they allow the model to work on its own to discover patterns and information that was previously undetected. It mainly deals 
with the unlabelled data.]

[Unsupervised learning has different types, one being K-means clustering that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the 
cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.]

### Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
[Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data 
visualization methods. EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better 
understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis 
are appropriate. Originally developed by American mathematician John Tukey in the 1970s, EDA techniques continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery 
process today.]
